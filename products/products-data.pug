It’s wired -- embedded electronics wouldn’t survive in the oven or on the grill -- and plugs into a phone or tablet to provide temperature graphs and instant readouts. There’s a short, pointy version for meats and a long, rounded version for liquids. Each one has a heat-resistant silicon handle that’s designed to grip the sides of a pot or pan, and the cord has a magnet that can grab the side of the range to prevent dangling. The app can also send data and alerts to your other devices, so you can leave the tablet at home monitoring the roast while you take your phone on a run to the store for that missing ingredient."};
